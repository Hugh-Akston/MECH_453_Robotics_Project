* What needs to be accomplished by the robot?
  1. User sets up the whiteboard
  2. User places the robot near the whiteboard
  3. User plugs the robot in to the computer and power supply
  4. User uploads the Arduino sketch to the robot
  5. User types in a math expression like “4+2” into the serial monitor and then presses enter on their keyboard
  6. The Arduino takes in the math expression and converts it into code that is understandable by the Arduino
  7. The Arduino computes the answer to the “converted” mathematical expression
  8. The Arduino sends a message to the robot arm and causes the arm to move toward the whiteboard into the writing position for the first number
  9. The Arduino sends another message to robot arm telling it to write the first digit of the answer to the mathematical expression
  10. The robot arm writes the first digit and then moves back away from the board into the “home” position.
  11. If there is a second digit that needs to be written, the Arduino tells the robot arm to move from the home position to the board in the second position.
  12. The Arduino sends a message to the robot arm telling it to write the second digit of the answer
  13. The robot arm writes the second digit of the answer
  14. The robot arm returns to the home position
  15. The Arduino prints to the serial monitor a message telling the user that the answer has been written out
  16. If the user wants to use The Math Robot to solve another equation, they will need to erase the whiteboard manually and then send another message into the serial monitor
